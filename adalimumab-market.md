<p><strong>Adalimumab Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The Adalimumab market is characterized by a competitive landscape featuring several key players, including AbbVie, Amgen, Sandoz, Boehringer Ingelheim, Mylan, and Biogen. AbbVie is the original developer of Adalimumab, marketed as Humira, which has historically dominated the market due to its broad therapeutic applications, including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In 2023, AbbVie reported sales exceeding $20 billion from Humira alone, although sales are anticipated to decline due to increasing biosimilar competition.</p><p>Amgen entered the biosimilars segment with its version of Adalimumab, Amjevita, aiming to capture market share as Humira faces patent expirations. Amgen's robust pipeline and commitment to biosimilars position it for steady growth, projecting a sharp increase in revenue from this segment.</p><p>Sandoz and Boehringer Ingelheim also have strong portfolios, with Sandoz's Hyrimoz gaining traction in various markets. Sandoz focuses on affordability and accessibility, which is essential as healthcare systems prioritize cost-effective therapies.</p><p>Mylan (now part of Viatris) has expanded its biosimilars with Mylan's biosimilar Adalimumab gaining approval, contributing to the growing competition. Viatris aims to leverage its global presence for future growth.</p><p>Biogen, while primarily focused on neurological conditions, has shown interest in expanding its biosimilar offerings, targeting market diversification.</p><p>Overall, the global Adalimumab market size is projected to experience significant changes post-2023 due to biosimilar entries. The market is estimated to shift from previous highs towards a more fragmented landscape, with revenues from biosimilars expected to grow sharply, benefiting both healthcare systems and patients through reduced costs and increased treatment options.</p></p>
